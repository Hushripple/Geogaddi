# Geogaddi

Basic program made in Tkinter that seeks to be able to download videos, music, albums, among other things from different platforms.

There are many such tools and this one has no particularity, in fact, its existence is merely to cover personal needs and to practice creating software with Tkinter.

bandcamp-dl is necessary to be able to download things from Bandcamp. 

```pip3 install bandcamp-downloader```

# Future

I have plans to make this program work perfectly on both Windows and Linux, but at the moment this "project" is at a very early stage and will probably be a long time away.

# State

At the moment you can only download videos from YouTube and albums from Bandcamp. 

TODO:

- Fix videos always downloading in very low quality.
- ~~Fix that you can't really select the download path when downloading from Bandcamp.~~
- Download songs/lists from Soundcloud.
- Download albums from Spotify
- Download videos and gifs from Twitter
- Download videos from Instagram
